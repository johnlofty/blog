  <p>Today I get up at nearly 8 o&rsquo;clock as usual.
I Cooked some sauage and eggs as breakfast. After we finish breakfast, We
finally managed to play badminton in the community which my wife was planning to
for a few days.</p>

<p>We were enjoying it for about ten minutes, before it started to rain. &lsquo;Cause it
has been a long time since we play badminton last time.</p>

<p>But I still need to go to work. I&rsquo;m a little bored with my work lately. Because out
team&rsquo;s focus is on an other project, I find it confusing and disturbing. I&rsquo;m not
told to fully participated in the new project, felt like an outsider.</p>

<p>Reason?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not inclued in the project from beginning. meetings, plans, etc.</p>

<p>So I have a limited sense of belonging.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s the reason.</p>

<p>Anyway, Unexpectedly, When I was about to park my car,  I got an notice that out office was cut off for half day, so I drived back to home.</p>

<p>Working at home is not as intense as in office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this diary on the bed, and it feels really good to think about
feelings and write things done. I should keep writing.</p>
