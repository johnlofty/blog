      <description>Today I get up at nearly 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock as usual. I Cooked some sauage and eggs as breakfast. After we finish breakfast, We finally managed to play badminton in the community which my wife was planning to for a few days.
We were enjoying it for about ten minutes, before it started to rain. &amp;lsquo;Cause it has been a long time since we play badminton last time.
But I still need to go to work.</description>
